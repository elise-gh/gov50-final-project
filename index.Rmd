## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data relating to climate change. I have a few more specific ideas within this realm. I would be interested in exploring the mental health affects of climate change among Gen Z (people born between 1996 and 2010). I would also be interested in exploring the relationship between gender or religion/spirituality on relationships to the environment/beliefs about climate change.
